BiPolar KCombinator KCombinator
===============================

Honestly? I won't even insult your intelligence by thinking anyone would need
this term or it's applications explained to them

...Why?
=======

I was joking around about how HyperLogLog was almost a meaningless name, since it
doesn't do a great job telegraphing what it actually is (to me, anyways). I then
went and made up several joke data structures with absurd names, and then finally
made up this one.

I then thought to myself "You know... I could probably write that"
